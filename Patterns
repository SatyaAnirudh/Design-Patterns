Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occuring problems in software design.They are like pre made blue prints which you can customize to solve a problem.

You cannot just find a pattern and copy it into your solution.It is not specific piece of code.you have to follow pattern details and implement it to your solution.

Pattern consist of

-> Intent - briefly describes both problem and solution
-> Motivation - explains problem and solution pattern makes
-> Structure - shows each of pattern and how theyre related
-> Code example - example of implementation to easily understand

classification

-> Creational Patterns - provides object recreation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of exisiting code
-> Structural Patterns - assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexible and efficient
-> Behavioral Patterns - takes care of effective communication and assignment of responsibilities between objects



1) Factory Method

says define an interface or abstract class for creating an object but let the subclass decide which class to instantiate
use this when you dont know beforehand the exact types and dependencies of objects your code should work with
promotes loose coupling
